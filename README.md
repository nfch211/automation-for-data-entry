There, is a workplace where i tried to automate repeatable tasks
for the company i worked for.

Most of the jobs was really simple data entry,
for example, entries of business registration numbers in excel
where the company names, business registration number, expiry dates
and company addresses will be filled in.

At the beginning, i asked ChatGPT for python script to 
read the pdf, and extract data to excel worksheet. 
It could be really done without understanding any foundamentals of 
programming language, in my case, i was using python.

The algorithm of how it works is that i converted the pdf into docx,
and named these files as same as the pdf. Then, i 
extracted all the information as mentioned from the docx and saved these information to 
an excel file by a python script, * together with its' file names which is the key
to track back and link these information to the pdfs.

Finally, whenever i needed to input these information as requested,
all I need to do was simply to copy and paste.

The quantity of pdf could range from 100 to 2000.
The processing time could range from 30 mins to 4 hours.
One big issue was that, the texts converted from pdf are not 100% accurate,
it did take time for manual handling.
